			<h5>Market Simulation using Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents</h5>
			<p> Predicting market movements using historical data suffers from lack of knowledge that may arise due to
				unforseen events in the future. One way to overcome this problem is to supplement this with simulated
				market
				data from deep reinforcement agent simulations. My project involved designing a framework for training
				Deep
				Reinforcement Learning (DRL) network in agent-based price-order-book simulations. In this framework, the
				market acts as the environment while a DRL network acts as an agent that places order to the market. The
				agent tries to maximize rewards using feedback from the market outcomes. The DRL agent is constructed as
				an
				A2C (Advantage-Actor-Critic Network) that uses LSTM and CNN blocks for feature extraction.

			<h5>Brokerage Calculation Engine</h5>
			<p> Capital Markets involve a large number of transactions involving brokerage fees, where the bank can act
				either as a broker, or need services of another broker. Both these cases involve large amount of
				brokerage
				fees. Brokerage fees are dependent on many factors, such as the kind of transaction, the parties
				involved,
				the geographical location etc. I created Brokerage Calculation Preview Engine using Predictive modeling
				in R
				using R's dplyr and dbplyr libraries. This involved preprocessing a dataset consisting of a large number
				of
				features, feature engineering and best subset selection. I also implemented Lasso Regression for feature
				subsetting to handle the large feature issue. </p>
			<br />
			<h5>Automated Testcase Generation </h5>
			<p> This project involved designing a A Natural Language Processing framework for generating testcases. In
				many
				project workflows, the communication gap between the Quality Assessment Team and the Development Team
				can
				lead to significant latencies, in terms of integration testing. I was part of a team that designed a
				Java
				framework using the Apache Jenna and Stanford Parser libraries to perform Parts of Speech (POS) tagging
				and
				generate semantic knowledge graphs, querying the knowledge graph to create Gherkin scripts which are
				then
				fed into Cucumber test runner to generate JUnit Testcases.</p>
			<br />
			<h5>Real-Time Processing of Big Data for Auditing </h5>
			<p> Trade Auditing in the financial sector is a time sensitive process that can benefit from moving to
				real-time
				processing from batch-processing. This project involved converting +1 day batch processing of large
				volume
				of Audit data from batch processing to real-time processing using Apache Storm and Kafka. Apache Storm
				is an
				open source distributed realtime computation system which makes it easy to reliably process unbounded
				streams of data, doing for realtime processing what Hadoop does for batch processing. A Storm Topology
				consists of spouts and bolts. A spout is a source of streams in a computation, and a bolt processes any
				number of input streams and produces any number of new output streams. Most of the logic of a
				computation
				goes into bolts, such as functions, filters, streaming joins, streaming aggregations, talking to
				databases,
				and so on. Apache Kafka was used as messaging service for this project, and MongoDB was used for
				persisting
				the data.</p>
